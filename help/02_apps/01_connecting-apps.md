# Connecting Apps

This guide walks you through the process of connecting apps to your TetiAI workspace, allowing you to extend TetiAI's capabilities with external services.

## Before You Begin

Before connecting an app, make sure you:

- Have an active account with the service you want to connect
- Have necessary permissions if connecting to organization accounts
- Understand the permissions you'll be granting to TetiAI

## Connecting Your First App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the App Marketplace">
    Click on "Apps" in the sidebar to open the App Marketplace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find an App">
    Browse the available apps or use the search function to find the specific app you want to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View App Details">
    Click on the app card to view more details about the app's functionality and required permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Connection">
    Click the "Connect" button on the app card or app details page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Authentication">
    Follow the authentication flow for the selected app. This typically involves:
    - Being redirected to the service's login page
    - Granting specific permissions to TetiAI
    - Being redirected back to TetiAI
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Connection">
    Once authentication is complete, you'll see a confirmation message that the app is connected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Types

TetiAI apps use different authentication methods depending on the service:

### OAuth Authentication (Most Common)

  <Step title="Redirect to Service">
    You'll be redirected to the service's authentication page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Log in to your account if you're not already logged in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Permissions">
    Review the permissions TetiAI is requesting and approve them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to TetiAI">
    You'll be redirected back to TetiAI with the connection established.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### API Key Authentication

For services that use API keys:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Connection">
    TetiAI will verify the API key and establish the connection.

## Example: Connecting Gmail

Here's a specific example of connecting the Gmail app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Gmail">

    - Read, send, and manage emails
    - View and manage labels
    - Access your contact information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve">
    Click "Allow" to grant these permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You'll be redirected back to TetiAI with Gmail now connected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try It Out">
    Try asking TetiAI something like "Show my recent emails" or "Draft an email to [contact]."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Connected Apps

To view and manage your connected apps:

    - Disconnect the app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Disconnecting Apps

To disconnect an app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Connected Apps">
    Navigate to the "Connected" tab in the Apps section.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm that you want to disconnect the app when prompted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Disconnecting an app will immediately revoke TetiAI's access to that service. Any triggers or actions relying on that app will stop working.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Connections

If you encounter issues when connecting apps:

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection times out | Try again, ensure stable internet connection |
| Permission denied | Make sure you have the right account permissions |
| App already connected | Disconnect the existing connection first |
| Connection fails | Check if the service is down or try a different browser |

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the [TetiAI support portal](https://help.teti.ai) for known issues
2. Contact support by clicking on "Help" in the bottom left corner of the app
3. Email support@teti.ai with details about the issue

## Next Steps

Once you've connected your first app, try:

- Asking TetiAI to perform tasks using the connected app
- Connecting additional apps to expand functionality
- Creating [triggers](/user-interface/triggers) that use your connected apps
