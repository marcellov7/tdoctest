# Memories

TetiAI's memory system allows you to store important information that TetiAI will remember and use in future conversations. This page explains how memories work and how to use them effectively.

## Understanding Memories

There are two types of memories in TetiAI:

1. **User Memories**: Facts, preferences, and information explicitly saved by you
2. **AI Memories**: Important details that TetiAI automatically remembers to provide better service

Memories persist across all conversations and topics, making them useful for information you want TetiAI to remember long-term.

## Creating Memories

### Method 1: Direct Request

The simplest way to create a memory is to directly ask TetiAI to remember something:

- "Remember that my favorite color is blue"
- "Please remember my wife's birthday is May 15th"
- "Save this information: I'm allergic to peanuts"
- "Remember that I prefer to use Google Docs for collaborative writing"

TetiAI will confirm when information has been saved to memory.

### Method 2: Memory Extraction from Conversations

TetiAI can automatically identify and save important information from your conversations:

1. Share relevant information in your conversation
2. TetiAI will identify important facts
3. When TetiAI saves a memory, you'll see a "Memory saved" indicator
4. Click this indicator to see what was saved

Example conversation:

```
You: I'm planning a trip to Japan next month, from June 12th to June 25th. I'll be visiting Tokyo and Kyoto.

TetiAI: That sounds exciting! Japan is beautiful in June. How can I help with your planning?

[Memory saved indicator appears]
```

## Deleting Memories

You can delete user memories that are no longer needed:

1. Click the brain icon to open the Memories sidebar
2. Find the memory you want to delete
3. Click the trash icon next to the memory
4. Confirm deletion when prompted

<Note>
  AI Memories cannot be directly deleted, but they will automatically expire when no longer relevant.
</Note>

## How TetiAI Uses Memories

TetiAI uses stored memories to:

- **Personalize Responses**: Tailor answers based on your preferences
- **Maintain Continuity**: Remember important context across separate conversations
- **Avoid Repetition**: Reduce the need to repeat the same information
- **Improve Recommendations**: Provide better suggestions based on your needs

Example of memory in use:

```
You: Can you recommend some restaurants for my trip?

TetiAI: Since you're visiting Tokyo and Kyoto from June 12th to 25th, here are some restaurant recommendations for both cities...
```

## Best Practices for Memories

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, concrete information you want remembered
- **Prioritize Important Details**: Save information you'll reference frequently
- **Review Regularly**: Check and clean up outdated memories
- **Update When Needed**: If information changes, ask TetiAI to update the memory
- **Consider Privacy**: Only save information you're comfortable having stored

## Memory Limitations

- Memories have a character limit (approximately 500 characters per memory)
- TetiAI cannot store sensitive information like passwords or financial details
- There is a limit to how many memories can be stored (current limit: 100 user memories)
