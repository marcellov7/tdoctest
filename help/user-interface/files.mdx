## Upload Status

After initiating an upload, you'll see the status of each file:

- **Uploading**: File is in the process of being uploaded
- **Completed**: File has been successfully uploaded and is ready to use
- **Error**: Upload failed (hover over for error details)

You can cancel an upload in progress by clicking the X button next to the file.

## Working with Uploaded Files

Once your files are uploaded, you can interact with them in various ways:

### Asking Questions

Simply type your questions about the file content in the message input field. For example:

- "Summarize this document for me"
- "What are the main points in this PDF?"
- "Extract all the dates mentioned in this file"
- "What's the total in column B of this spreadsheet?"
- "Describe what's in this image"

### Multiple Files

When working with multiple files, you can:

- Ask about specific files: "What does the first PDF say about climate change?"
- Compare files: "What are the differences between these two documents?"
- Analyze all files together: "Summarize all these files"

## Large Text Files

If you paste a very large text (over 1000 lines) into the chat, TetiAI will automatically convert it to a file upload instead of including it directly in the message. This helps manage the conversation context efficiently.

## Tips for Effective File Analysis

- **Be Specific**: Ask focused questions about the parts of the file you're interested in
- **Start Simple**: Begin with general questions before diving into details
- **Provide Context**: Tell TetiAI what aspect of the file you want to analyze
- **Clarify When Needed**: If TetiAI misunderstands something about the file, correct it
- **Use Multiple Questions**: Break down complex analyses into a series of simpler questions

## Examples of File Analysis Prompts

Here are some effective prompts for different file types:

### Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

- "Extract the key points from this document"
- "Find all mentions of [specific term] in this PDF"
- "Create a bullet-point summary of the main arguments"
- "What are the action items mentioned in this document?"

### Spreadsheets (CSV, XLSX)

- "What trends do you see in this data?"
- "Calculate the average value in column C"
- "Identify the top 5 values in this spreadsheet"
- "Create a summary of what this data represents"

### Presentations (PPT, PPTX)

- "Summarize the key points from each slide"
- "Extract all statistics mentioned in this presentation"
- "What are the main conclusions from this deck?"

### Images (JPG, PNG, etc.)

- "Describe what you see in this image"
- "Are there any text elements in this image? What do they say?"
- "What objects can you identify in this picture?"
