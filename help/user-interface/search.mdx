## Search Results

Search results are organized into sections:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/search-results.png" alt="Search Results" />
</Frame>

Each result includes:

- The question or message containing your search terms
- A snippet of the response
- The topic it belongs to (if applicable)
- The date and time of the message
- Match type (topic title, message content, etc.)

Results are sorted by relevance, with exact matches appearing first.

## Search Filters

You can refine your search using filters:

### Date Filters

- **Recent**: Last 7 days
- **Past Month**: Last 30 days
- **Past Year**: Last 365 days
- **All Time**: No date restriction

### Content Filters

- **All Content**: Search across all message types
- **Questions Only**: Search only your messages
- **Answers Only**: Search only TetiAI's responses
- **Topic Titles**: Search only in topic titles

To apply filters, click the filter icon next to the search field and select your preferences.

## Advanced Search Syntax

TetiAI supports advanced search syntax for more precise queries:

- **Exact Phrases**: Use quotes for exact matches, e.g., "project timeline"
- **Exclusion**: Use minus (-) to exclude terms, e.g., meeting -zoom
- **Topic Focus**: Use in: followed by topic name, e.g., project in:marketing
- **Date Range**: Use after: and before: with dates, e.g., report after:2023-01-01

## Navigating to Search Results

To navigate to a specific search result:

1. Click on the result in the search sidebar
2. TetiAI will navigate to the relevant conversation
3. The matching message will be highlighted and scrolled into view

For topic title matches, clicking the result will take you to that topic.

## Search Tips

To get the most out of TetiAI's search:

- **Use Specific Terms**: More specific search terms yield more precise results
- **Include Context Words**: Add relevant context (like project names) to narrow results
- **Try Different Phrasings**: If you don't find what you're looking for, try alternative wording
- **Use Wildcards**: Use * for partial matches (e.g., "present*" will match "presentation," "presenting," etc.)
- **Refine With Filters**: Start broad, then use filters to narrow down results

## Search Limitations

Be aware of these limitations when searching:

- Search currently does not include file contents (only message text)
- Very short terms (under 3 characters) are not indexed
- Common words (like "the," "and," "is") are filtered out
- There's a maximum of 100 results returned per search
- Deleted messages and topics are not included in search results
