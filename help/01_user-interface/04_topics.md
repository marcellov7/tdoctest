# Topics

Topics in TetiAI help you organize your conversations by subject, project, or any category you choose. They work similar to channels in messaging apps or threads in forums, allowing you to maintain separate conversation contexts.

## Benefits of Using Topics

- **Organization**: Keep conversations on different subjects separate
- **Context Management**: Maintain focused context for specific projects or tasks
- **Easy Navigation**: Quickly find and reference past conversations
- **Collaboration**: Share organized information with team members (in team workspaces)

## Creating Topics

There are three ways to create a topic:

### 1. Using the New Topic Button

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the New Topic Button">
    Click the "+" button next to "Topics" in the sidebar, or click "New Topic" if there are no existing topics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Your Conversation">
    In the new topic, start your conversation with TetiAI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Topic">
    TetiAI will suggest a name based on your initial message, or you can click the topic title to edit it yourself.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. From an Existing Conversation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Message">
    In the general chat, locate a message from TetiAI that you want to turn into a topic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Topic">
    Click the "Create topic from this" button below the message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    TetiAI will create a new topic containing the selected conversation, and you can continue the discussion there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. By Asking TetiAI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a New Topic">
    Simply ask TetiAI to create a new topic about a specific subject, e.g., "Create a topic about my marketing campaign" or "Let's start a new topic for my project planning."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Creation">
    TetiAI will create the topic and redirect your conversation there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Topics

2. Edit the name in the text field that appears
3. Press Enter or click outside the field to save

To prioritize important topics:

1. Hover over a topic in the sidebar
2. Click the pin icon that appears
3. The topic will remain at the top of your topics list

### Deleting Topics

<Note>
  Topic deletion is currently only available for workspace administrators.
</Note>

To delete a topic (if you have permission):

1. Go to Dashboard Settings > Content Management
2. Find the topic in the list

## Topic Metadata

Each topic displays additional information:

- **Message Count**: The number of messages in the topic
- **Last Active**: When the topic was last used
- **Created**: When the topic was created

This metadata helps you manage and prioritize your topics effectively.

## Best Practices

For the most effective use of topics:

- **Create Focused Topics**: Keep topics specific to a single project, question, or theme
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name topics clearly to find them easily later
- **Pin Important Topics**: Keep frequently used topics accessible
- **Regularly Review**: Archive or delete old topics that are no longer needed
- **Start Fresh**: When a conversation drifts off-topic, consider creating a new topic
