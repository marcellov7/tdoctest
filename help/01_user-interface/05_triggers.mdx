# Triggers

Triggers are automated actions that TetiAI can perform at scheduled times or under specific conditions. They allow you to set reminders, schedule tasks, and automate recurring actions.

## Types of Triggers

TetiAI supports two main types of triggers:

1. **One-Time Triggers**: Execute a single action at a specific date and time
2. **Recurring Triggers**: Execute actions on a repeating schedule (daily, weekly, monthly)

## Creating Triggers

Creating triggers is simple - just tell TetiAI what you want to automate:

### Method 1: Natural Language Request

Simply ask TetiAI to create a trigger in your own words:

- "Remind me to call Mom tomorrow at 5pm"
- "Send me a daily summary of my emails at 9am"
- "Create a weekly reminder to submit my timesheet every Friday at 4pm"
- "Notify me about my meeting with John on Tuesday morning"

TetiAI will understand your request and create the appropriate trigger.

### Examples of Trigger Requests

<CodeGroup>
```text One-Time Reminders
"Remind me to take my medication at 8pm tonight"
"Send me an email about project deliverables on October 15th"
"Alert me about Sarah's birthday on March 23rd"
"Set a reminder for my dentist appointment next Tuesday at 2pm"
```

```text Recurring Actions
"Send me a weather report every morning at 7am"
"Remind me to water the plants every Monday and Thursday"
"Create a monthly reminder to pay rent on the 1st"
"Email me a summary of my calendar every Sunday night at 8pm"
```

```text Conditional Actions
"Notify me if any emails from my boss arrive after 6pm"
"Send me an alert when my flight status changes"
"Let me know if it's going to rain tomorrow"
"Alert me if any new files are added to my project folder"
```

## Trigger Status Indicators

Each trigger has a status that shows its current state:

- **ACTIVE**: Trigger is enabled and will execute as scheduled
- **PAUSED**: Trigger is temporarily disabled
- **COMPLETED**: One-time trigger that has already executed
- **EXPIRED**: Trigger has reached its end date or failed too many times

## Execution History

For each trigger, you can view its execution history:

1. Click on a trigger in the triggers sidebar
2. Click "View History"
3. See past executions, including successful runs and failures

This helps you track when triggers ran and troubleshoot any issues.

## Pausing and Resuming Triggers

To temporarily disable a trigger:

1. Open the Triggers sidebar
2. Find the trigger you want to pause
3. Click the pause button (or status toggle)
4. The trigger will remain paused until you resume it

To resume a paused trigger, click the play button.

## Deleting Triggers

To permanently remove a trigger:

1. Open the Triggers sidebar
2. Find the trigger you want to delete
3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion when prompted

<Warning>
  Deleting a trigger is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Limitations and Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Be specific about dates, times, and actions
- **Time Zones**: Times are set in your local time zone
- **Permissions**: Triggers may require permissions for connected apps
- **Expiration**: Triggers automatically expire after 90 days if not renewed
- **Limit**: Each user can have up to 20 active triggers
- **Notifications**: Trigger notifications can be delivered via email or in-app messages
