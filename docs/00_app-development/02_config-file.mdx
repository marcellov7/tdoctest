# Config File Reference

The `config.json` file is the primary configuration file for your TetiAI app, defining its metadata, appearance, authentication methods, and user-facing information. This document provides a detailed reference for creating and customizing your app's configuration.

## Basic Structure

A complete `config.json` file includes these main sections:

```json
{
  "name": "APP_NAME",
  "display_name": "App Display Name",
  "description": "A detailed description of what your app does",
  "logo": "https://path-to-your-logo.svg",
  "docs_url": "https://your-documentation-url.com",
  "support_url": "https://your-support-url.com",
  "terms_url": "https://your-terms-url.com",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Company",
    "url": "https://your-company-website.com",
    "logo": "https://path-to-your-company-logo.svg"
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "has_costs": false,
  "security_schemes": {
    // Authentication configuration
  },
  "categories": ["Category1", "Category2"],
  "prompts": [
    "Example prompt 1",
    "Example prompt 2"
  ],
  "changelog": [

## Authentication Configuration

The `security_schemes` object defines how your app authenticates with the external service:

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication

For apps requiring OAuth 2.0:

```json
"security_schemes": {
  "oauth2": {
    "location": "header",
    "name": "Authorization",
    "prefix": "Bearer",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly",
    "authorize_url": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "access_token_url": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "refresh_token_url": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "access_type": "offline",
    "prompt": "consent",
    "response_type": "code"
  }
}
```

### API Key Authentication

For apps using API keys:

```json
"security_schemes": {
  "api_key": {
    "location": "header",
    "name": "X-API-Key",
    "prefix": "",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "api_key",
        "type": "password",
        "required": true,
        "description": "Your API key from the service dashboard"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For detailed authentication configuration options, see the [Authentication Guide](/app-development/authentication).

## Additional Settings

### has_costs

Indicates if using the app may incur costs:

```json
"has_costs": true
```

Set to `true` if:
- The app connects to a paid API or service
- Usage may result in charges to the user's account
- The app integrates with a premium service

## Next Steps

After configuring your app with the `config.json` file, you'll need to:

1. Define your app's functions in the [functions.json file](/app-development/functions-file)
2. Set up [authentication](/app-development/authentication) for your app
3. [Test](/app-development/testing) your app before submission
