# Introduction to App Development

Welcome to the TetiAI App Development Guide. This documentation will help you create and publish your own apps for the TetiAI marketplace, enabling you to extend TetiAI's capabilities and integrate with external services.

## What Are TetiAI Apps?

TetiAI apps are integrations that connect TetiAI to external services, APIs, and data sources. They enable TetiAI to:

1. **Access External Data**: Retrieve information from services like Gmail, Calendar, or custom APIs
2. **Perform Actions**: Execute tasks like sending emails, scheduling events, or updating records
3. **Process Information**: Analyze data and return insights to users
4. **Extend Capabilities**: Add specialized functions for specific domains or use cases

## Why Build a TetiAI App?

There are several reasons to create a TetiAI app:

- **Extend Functionality**: Create integrations for services you use
- **Solve Specific Problems**: Address specific workflows or business needs
- **Share with Others**: Publish your app to the marketplace for others to use
- **Create Business Opportunities**: Build paid apps or enhance existing products

## App Development Process Overview

The TetiAI app development process consists of these main steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Plan Your App">
    Define your app's purpose, features, and required permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Configuration Files">
    Develop your app's config.json and functions.json files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Authentication">
    Set up OAuth or API key authentication for your service
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your App">
    Test your app's functionality in a development environment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for Review">
    Submit your app to TetiAI for review and approval
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to Marketplace">
    Once approved, your app will be published in the marketplace
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Prerequisites

Before you start building a TetiAI app, you should have:

- **API Knowledge**: Understanding of REST APIs and authentication methods
- **JSON Experience**: Familiarity with JSON format and structure
- **Service Credentials**: API keys or OAuth credentials for your service
- **Documentation**: Access to the API documentation for your service

## App Components

A TetiAI app consists of two main components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="App Configuration" icon="gear">
    Defines app metadata, authentication methods, and appearance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Function Definitions" icon="code">
    Specifies the actions and capabilities of your app
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### App Configuration (config.json)

The app configuration defines:

- App name, description, and logo
- Authentication methods and requirements
- Categorization and discovery information
- User-facing prompts and documentation
- Version control and changelog

### Function Definitions (functions.json)

The function definitions specify:

- Available functions and their parameters
- Data types and validation requirements
- Protocol details for REST API calls
- Response handling instructions
- Custom logic for complex operations

## App Types

TetiAI supports different types of apps:

### REST API Apps

Connect to standard REST APIs with JSON responses. Ideal for:
- Public APIs with standard authentication
- Simple CRUD operations
- Services with well-documented endpoints

### Connector Apps

Implement custom logic for complex operations or non-standard APIs. Suitable for:
- Services with complex authentication requirements
- APIs that require preprocessing or post-processing
- Custom workflows that combine multiple API calls

### Data Source Apps

Provide access to specialized data sources. Good for:
- Proprietary databases or knowledge bases
- Data that requires specialized formatting
- Content that needs specific permissions

## Development Tools

To help you build apps, TetiAI provides:

- **App Development Console**: Web-based IDE for creating and testing apps
- **App Testing Environment**: Sandbox to test your app before submission
- **Validation Tools**: Utilities to check your app configuration and functions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references
